Heretic RPG by Peewee RotA

## Summary
This is a gameplay mod that adds leveling and melee enhancements to Heretic. Each weapon gets a melee or similar attack for alt-fire. This enhances the RPG and fantasy elements of the game as well as gives players more options when out of ammo.

This mod was made for COOP but works fine in Single Player.

# Features

## Leveling
Players now have XP and gain XP when damaging a monster.

You'll need 1000 per current level to gain the next level. Each level gain resets XP, raises health max, heals the player, and slightly increases melee damage.

## Melee Alt Fires
Each weapon gains an alt fire designed to either help push away monsters, provide a big whack, or just plain give the player access to monster attacks that you've always wanted to try out.

### Staff
Swing's staff horizontally and pushes monsters back.

### Gauntlets
A single blast of red lightning that pushes monsters back.

### Gold Wand
Turns that badboy around and makes an offhand staff thrust attack.

### Ethereal Crossbow
Whips out one of those knight axes and chucks it at foes. (Consumes ammo)

### Dragon Claw
Swings a mourning star on a chain that follows your view. Swing horizontally this for maximum effect.

### Hellstaff
Charges, ram horns first, sending your enemies backwards and out of your way. Great for a quick get-away.

### Pheonix Rod
Sets the ground alight to trip up advancing foes.

### Fire Mace
A swift smash with this makes brings the wrath of crucible fires down upon your enemy, pushing them away. Hopefully they won't be dumb enough to come back for another.

### Tome Alt Fire
Experiment and enjoy.
