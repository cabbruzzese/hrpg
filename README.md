Heretic RPG by Peewee RotA

## Summary
This is a gameplay mod that adds classes, leveling, and melee enhancements to Heretic. Each weapon gets a melee or similar attack for alt-fire. The two new calsses get their own signature weapon. This enhances the RPG and fantasy elements of the game as well as gives players more options when out of ammo.

This mod was made for COOP but works fine in Single Player and deathmatch.

# Features

## New Classes

### Heretic
The base class. Starts with the most Trickery and is the fastest. All ranged weapons are balanced, best with weapons like the crossbow.

Best at movement and stealth.

Soul Essences give temporary invisibility.

### Heathen
A brute who likes to get up close and personal. Starts with a warhammer and the most health.

Best at melee and has the most heath.

Soul Essences give armor and makes the Heathen go berserk, greatly increases melee damage with strength weapons.

### Blasphemer
A magician who excells at magical staffs and wands. Starts with a spellbook and is the slowest.

Best at ranged magical weapons. By far the biggest damage dealer at range.

Soul Essences give a small amount of ammo.

## Leveling
Players now have XP and gain XP when damaging a monster.

You'll need 1000 per current level to gain the next level. Each level gain resets XP, raises health max, heals the player, increases stats.

Stat increases are randomized, but weighted to give more points to the highest score.

### Stats
There are 3 stats. Brutality, Trickery, and Corruption.

Each level increases stats. Each level the player increases 5 stat points, awarded randomly, weighted to go to the highest stat.

#### Brutality
Brute force and might.

Determines health increases at levels and increases melee damage with strength weapons. (War hammer, morning star, battering ram, firemace melee attack)

Health increases are randomized up to Brutality, with a minimum increase of 5 per level.

#### Trickery
Speed and cunning.

Determines damage with dexterity based weapons. (Staff, Crossbow, Dragon Claw, Fire Mace)

#### Corruption
Megic and raw power.

Determines damage with magic wands and staffs (Spellbook, Gold Wand, Hellstaff, Pheonix staff)

## Monster Soul Essence
Monsters sometimes drop soul essences which power the player. Their effect is based on class.

Every class gains some health back.

- Heretic becomes invisible for a short time
- Heathen gains armor and goes berserk, giving a damage bonus to the melee weapons.
- Blasphemer gains some ammo.

## Melee Alt Fires
Each weapon gains an alt fire designed to either help push away monsters, provide a big whack, or just plain give the player access to monster attacks that you've always wanted to try out.

### WarHammer
Bashes foes with one single hit, or a swipe that make 3 weaker attacks in a line.

### Spellbook
Sends a blast of fire through enemies, or does a close up cold touch attack.

### Staff
Swing's staff horizontally and pushes monsters back.

### Gauntlets
A single blast of red lightning that pushes monsters back.

### Gold Wand
Turns that badboy around and makes an offhand staff thrust attack.

### Ethereal Crossbow
Whips out one of those knight axes and chucks it at foes.

### Dragon Claw
Swings a mourning star on a chain that follows your view. Swing horizontally this for maximum effect.

### Hellstaff
Charges, ram horns first, sending your enemies backwards and out of your way. Great for a quick get-away.

### Pheonix Rod
Sets the ground alight to trip up advancing foes.

### Fire Mace
A swift smash with this makes brings the wrath of crucible fires down upon your enemy, pushing them away. Hopefully they won't be dumb enough to come back for another.

### Tome Alt Fire
Experiment and enjoy.
